Based on the demo project from the “Work with API” lecture for listing countries do the following:
    Main task
        • Integrate Room database in the project.
        • Define the database class, an entity for the Country object fetched from the API and a DAO with functions for the CRUD 
        (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
        • After the list of countries is fetched save each country in the database.
        • Turn off the internet connection of the device (physical or emulator).
        • On application start add a check for available internet connection (R&D).
        • In case no internet connection is available retrieve the list of countries from the database and show a Snackbar 
        informing the user for the missing internet connection and that information might be outdated.
        • If internet connection is available update the information in the database with the one fetched from the API.
    Bonus task
        • Create another entity to keep track of last update time.
        • Every time the countries are successfully fetched from the API update the last updated date and time.
        • Add a text element above the list showing the last update time.
        • Add another text element under the last update time that shows the number of countries in the list.
    Bonus task 2
        • Add an animated loading bar that is shown to users during the check for internet connection and the loading of the countries 
        (either from database or from the API). The loading bar should be shown when starting the application and should disappear 
        as soon as the countries list is passed to the adapter.
